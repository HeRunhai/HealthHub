# HealthHub

HealthHub is an advanced information system designed for hospitals, offering a mobile application for patients and a web application for doctors and hospital administrators. This system aims to streamline and computerize key hospital operations, including patient management, appointment scheduling, doctorâ€“patient interactions, and hospital administration tasks. HealthHub enhances user experience and operational efficiency by utilizing modern technologies such as microservices architecture, front-end and back-end separation, and real-time communication.
